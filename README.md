Purpose:
The main aim of the project is to create a spreadsheet similar to a Microsoft excel sheet/ Google sheet. The project has basic functionality for performing mathematical operations on the cells. The project is developed with the primary purpose of demonstrating RxJS observables. Efforts have been made to keep a simple and pleasant user interface similar to that of Microsoft excel sheet keeping the colors in shades of green and white.


Functionality:
•	As a user, I should be able to add rows to the spreadsheet using a plus button. 
•	As a user, I should be able to add columns to the spreadsheet using a plus button. 
•	As a user, I should be able to delete rows on the spreadsheet using a minus button. 
•	As a user, I should be able to delete columns on the spreadsheet using a minus button. 
•	As a user, I should be able to select multiple rows or columns and display their sum in a cell by using a   formula. 
•	The formula should be of the format "=SUM(START_CELL:END_CELL)". Example "=SUM(A1:A10)" to display the sum of all items from cell A1 to A10. 
•	Any changes to the cell content in the selected range should update the sum. 
•	As a user, I should be able to perform simple algebraic operations (+, -, *, /) with cell references. Example "=A1+A2". As a user, I should be able to export the sheet as a CSV file. 
•	As a user, I should be able to load a CSV from the node server by clicking a load button.


Technologies used:
•	Javascript
